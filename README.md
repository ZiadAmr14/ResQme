# ResQme Admin Dashboard

# What is ResQme?
ResQme is an android mobile application used to facilitate road rescuing services by:
- Providing the nearest towing car available in the area through shortest path algorithms
- Allowing Ordering and Delivering Spare Parts to customers.
- Grouping Car Maintenance Centers in a single application and allowing them to provide their services to customers.

#### Here is the repository for the Android Application: https://github.com/TawfikYasser/ResQme-GP

# What is the dashboard responsible for?
- The admin uses the dashboard for validating the credentials of the registered service providers and deciding whether the service provider's credentials are valid enough to accept him in the mobile app or he should provide more credible information about his Towing Car or Car Maintenance Center or his Spare Parts.
- The Admin also uses the dashboard to review the reports made by any user in the application.
